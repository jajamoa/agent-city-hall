    "description": "The Kendall Square Mixed-Use Development is a proposed 5-story, 85,000-square-foot building in Cambridge, MA, combining residential, commercial, and public green space. The project allocates 50% of the space to 35 residential units (15 one-bedroom, 15 two-bedroom, and 5 three-bedroom), 30% to retail and dining (25,500 sq. ft.), and 20% to public and rooftop green spaces (17,000 sq. ft.). It includes 20 underground parking spaces (15 for residents, 5 for commercial use) and aims to meet LEED Gold standards with solar panels and advanced stormwater management. While complying with mixed-use zoning, it requires a height variance for exceeding the 60-foot limit. Key impacts include a 15% increase in parking demand, a net gain of 6 trees, and a projected daily increase of 120 pedestrian trips. Community concerns focus on height, parking, and green space preservation, balanced against the projectâ€™s contribution to housing and commercial opportunities."
